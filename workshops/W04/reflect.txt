in this workhop i have learned and gained a chance on practicing to implement diffrent operators in a C++ class.
also I have implemented some binary member operators, type conversion, unary member and subscript operators as mentioned in lab goals.
my main challenge was on how to imlement the operators syntax wise and not being sure what does the documentation is trying to tell me on what to do...
so anyway it took me some time to make sense of the main logic of the project so i could understand whats going on. (later i learned i didnt need to so ...).
still have a feeling that the syllabus is not understood properly, in which i find the reasone on how fast the titles are passing bye in lecture classes; in which i dont see the reasone in my instructors speed of teaching but in how the syllabuses of this course have been put (and squished) together.
at the end the lab helped me more on playing with the concept of pointers and references as well.

Thank you
