# ----------------------------------- Body ----------------------------------- #

Workshop expected outcomes:
    - Define pure virtual functions
    - Create abstract base classes
    - Implement behavior using virtual functions
    - Explain the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class
    - Reflect on what you have learned in completing this workshop

Message:
It's been a while since my last time submitting this course workshop on time and properly, I did have some difficulty following the material and
keeping up with class. however I took the time i needed ad learned so much on my own and thanks to the material Prof. has left us.

For getting ready for this workshop and gettig comfortable with the concept of virtual and pure virtual functions I have worked a little on the sandbox present in my repository
(ref to the folder: https://github.com/ArashkKH/OOPS2025/tree/b1bae0bc22b755b54892ce5164b8a696c486dd65/sandbox/textBook/virtualFunctions)

In this workshop I did get into some more problem in case of encountering memory leaks and output buffer  difficulties. for instance the rectangle function would print an extra new
character whenever it would be called on user input, the problem would be solved with using the input stream -> ignore method to clear the buffer.

I've also got more confortable with defining abstract base classes and making Pure virtual methods defining differnet behaviours for those functions.
