#include <iostream>
/*
- Helper functions
- Gettter fnctions to help helper functions
- Helper operators => basically you can declare simple operands which are not designed for other data types to be functional for more complex manners as well
- Friends and Friendships -> having access to isolated data (which will ruin the isolation 😐)
    a freind function is not a helper, firends are more likely to be a member function.
- modifying ptput stream of std to support custom class types
